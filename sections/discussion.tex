Our comparative study between graph databases and relational databases reveals several critical insights that underscore the strengths and limitations of each database model. Through practical examples and performance evaluations, we have identified scenarios where graph databases, such as Neo4j, and relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, excel.

Firstly, graph databases demonstrate superior performance in handling complex and interconnected data. This advantage stems from their data structure, which natively represents relationships using nodes and edges. As demonstrated in our Cypher example, querying interconnected data in Neo4j is both intuitive and efficient, enabling quick retrieval of complex relationship patterns. This inherent capability makes graph databases particularly suitable for applications such as social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection systems, where relationships between entities are central to the data model.

However, our analysis also highlights several challenges associated with graph databases. One significant issue is their performance degradation with large data loads. As Guia et al. noted, Neo4j exhibits robust performance for smaller datasets but struggles with larger datasets, sometimes requiring significant time to load data and execute queries efficiently \footnote{Guia, J., Soares, V. G., \& Bernardino, J. (2018). Graph Databases: Neo4j Analysis. ISEC, Polytechnic of Coimbra; Informatics Centre, Federal University of Paraiba; CISUC - Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra}. This limitation suggests that while graph databases are powerful tools for certain applications, they may not always be the optimal choice for very large datasets without careful query optimization and performance tuning.

In contrast, relational databases like PostgreSQL offer more predictable performance across a wider range of applications. Their structured data model and use of SQL make them well-suited for traditional data-intensive applications where data consistency and integrity are paramount. As Vicknair et al. reported, relational databases efficiently handle scenarios where data relationships are relatively simple and can be managed through joins and indexed searches \footnote{Vicknair, C., Macias, M., Zhao, Z., Nan, X., Chen, Y., \& Wilkins, D. (2010). A comparison of a graph database and a relational database: a data provenance perspective. Proceedings of the 48th Annual Southeast Regional Conference. \url{https://doi.org/10.1145/1900008.1900067}}.

However, relational databases face challenges in scenarios involving complex, many-to-many relationships. The complexity of SQL queries required to navigate such relationships can lead to inefficiencies and increased query execution times. This is particularly evident in scenarios requiring recursive queries, where graph databases can execute more straightforward and efficient queries using their native traversal mechanisms.

Our study also underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate database model based on the specific needs of the application. While NoSQL databases, including graph databases, offer significant advantages for handling unstructured and semi-structured data, relational databases remain valuable for applications requiring structured data and strong consistency guarantees. As Sharma et al. noted, NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Neo4j outperform relational databases in managing voluminous, heterogeneous geospatial data \footnote{Sharma, M., Sharma, V. D., \& Bundele, M. M. (2018).
