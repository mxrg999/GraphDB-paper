The landscape of database technologies has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Traditionally, relational databases, based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd in the 1970s, have been the cornerstone of data storage and management. These databases organize data into tables with predefined schemas, making them suitable for structured data and transactional applications. However, the rise of web-scale applications, social networks, and big data has exposed the limitations of relational databases in handling highly interconnected and dynamic data.

Graph databases have emerged as a powerful alternative to relational databases for managing complex and interconnected datasets. Unlike relational databases, graph databases model data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), allowing for more natural and flexible data representation. This approach is particularly effective for applications that require traversing relationships, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

Despite the growing interest in graph databases, there is still a need for a comprehensive comparison with traditional relational databases to understand their respective strengths and limitations. Developers and data scientists often face challenges in selecting the appropriate database technology for their specific needs, especially when dealing with complex data structures and relationships.

The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comparative study between graph databases and relational databases. Using Neo4j as a representative of graph databases and PostgreSQL as a representative of relational databases, we aim to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and suitability for different types of applications.


This paper is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section 2:} An overview of graph databases, including their types and unique characteristics.
    \item \textbf{Section 3:} A detailed comparison between graph databases and relational databases, focusing on paradigm differences, query languages, and data modeling.
    \item \textbf{Section 4:} Discussion of related work, highlighting existing research and studies on this topic.
    \item \textbf{Section 5:} A discussion summarizing the key findings in the comparative study.
    \item \textbf{Section 6:} Conclusions and suggestions for future work.
\end{itemize}
