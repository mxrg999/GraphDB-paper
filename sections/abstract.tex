% Description: Abstract of the paper
This paper explores the differences between graph databases and traditional relational databases. Using Neo4j and PostgreSQL, we look at the advantages of each model through example queries and paradigm differences. We find that graph databases are more efficient in managing complex and interconnected data, while relational databases are more suitable for applications that require structured data. We conclude that graph databases are not a one-size-fits-all solution and that future research could explore hybrid models that combine the strengths of both database types.
