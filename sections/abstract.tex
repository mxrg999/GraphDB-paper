This study explores the performance and application differences between graph databases and traditional relational databases. Using Neo4j and PostgreSQL, we demonstrate the advantages of each model through a series of tests on diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that while graph databases offer superior performance for complex query environments, relational databases remain effective for structured data applications.
