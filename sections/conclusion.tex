The conclusion of this paper is that graph databases take the upper hand in managing complex and interconnected data. But they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the data-handling needs of an application, relational databases may be more suitable. Future research could explore hybrid models that combine the strengths of both database types.
