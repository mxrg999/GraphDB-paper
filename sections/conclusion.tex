The conclusion of this paper is that graph databases take the upper hand in managing complex and interconnected data. But they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the data-handling needs of an application, relational databases may be more suitable. Future research could explore hybrid models that combine the strengths of both database types. 


% What we have done:
% demonstrated the difference with the relational database model. / the paradigm differences between graph databases and relational databases. 
% we demonstrated the differences between the query languages used in graph databases(Cypher) and relational databases(SQL).
% we compared the differences in how they store the data.
% we looked at other papers on graph databases and relational databases, comparing them, looking at previous work, and seeing what they have done.
%       we found that performance 
%       we found that they are more bendable
