\subsection{Differences Between Graph and Relational Databases}
Graph databases, like Neo4j, represent data as nodes and edges, which allows for more natural modeling of relationships compared to the table-based structure of relational databases such as PostgreSQL.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis Using Neo4j and PostgreSQL}
We provide a comparative analysis through specific scenarios where each database model's performance, scalability, and query complexity are examined.
